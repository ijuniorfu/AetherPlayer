## Install

**macOS:** grab the latest notarized `.dmg` from the [Releases page](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherPlayer/releases), drag AetherPlayer to your Applications folder, and launch it. The app keeps itself current through built-in auto-updates (Sparkle), so you only have to download it once.

**iOS/iPadOS:** the iOS app is not yet on the App Store or TestFlight; build and run it from source (see [Build](#build) below).

## macOS features

- **Plays what other players choke on.** FFmpeg-backed decoding through AetherEngine, with an on-screen `native`/`sw` badge so you can see which rendering path a file took.
- **Audio too, with system Now Playing.** Open a music or audio file and AetherPlayer shows a dedicated Now Playing view (embedded cover art over a blurred backdrop, or a generated gradient when there is none). Playback wires into Control Center, the lock screen, and the keyboard media keys via `MPNowPlayingInfoCenter`.
- **Audio and subtitle track switching** from the menu bar or the tracks popover, with an "Off" option for subtitles. Drop an `.srt` onto a playing video to attach it as a sidecar track, and pick the subtitle size from the Window menu.
- **Disc titles and chapters.** Open a decrypted DVD-Video or Blu-ray `.iso` (from the Open dialog, a drop onto the window, or Finder's *Open With*) and the tracks popover lists its titles (pick one to switch) and the playing title's chapters (click to jump).
- **Scrub bar with live preview.** Hover the timeline for a thumbnail, click to seek, or drag to scrub.
- **Frame capture.** Save the current frame at full resolution (Cmd+Shift+S, or the camera button).
- **Recents with thumbnails.** Recently opened files show disk-cached keyframe thumbnails for quick visual recognition.
- **Resume where you left off.** Reopen a file and pick up at your last position.
- **Folder playlists.** Open a folder and step through its videos with Cmd+Left / Cmd+Right.
- **Tunable buffering.** Preferences (Cmd+,) set how far ahead to buffer, for slow or unstable network sources.
- **Stats for Nerds.** A live inspector window (Cmd+Shift+I) showing the active backend and decoder, resolution, frame rate, dynamic range, display mode, video and audio bitrate, channels, A/V sync, dropped frames, and buffer state.
- **Stays out of the way.** Controls auto-hide during video playback and reappear on mouse movement.

## Controls

| Action | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| Space / click | Play / pause |
| Double-click / F | Toggle fullscreen |
| Left / Right | Seek -/+ 10s |
| Cmd+Left / Cmd+Right | Previous / next in folder |
| Up / Down | Volume +/- 5% |
| M | Mute / unmute |
| Escape | Exit fullscreen, else stop |
| Cmd+O | Open file |
| Cmd+Shift+O | Open folder |
| Cmd+Shift+S | Save current frame |
| Cmd+, | Preferences |
| Cmd+Shift+T | Toggle always on top |
| Cmd+Shift+I | Stats for Nerds |

The system media keys and Control Center transport also drive play / pause and track stepping, handy for audio.

## iOS/iPadOS features

A universal iPhone + iPad app (same source tree, sharing the playback core with the macOS app):

- **Open local files or a URL.** Pick a video or audio file from the Files app, or paste an `http`/`https` URL.
- **Custom playback chrome, matching the macOS design.** A transport bar with a scrubber (monospaced leading/trailing timecodes), a floating scrub-thumbnail preview while dragging, play/pause, and -/+10s skip. A top bar with Close, AirPlay, and Tracks. Controls tap to show/hide and auto-hide during playback, and a replay button appears when playback reaches the end.
- **Picture in Picture, AirPlay, and lock-screen Now Playing.** Playback is still hosted in an `AVPlayerViewController` under the hood, so PiP, AirPlay routing, and Control Center / lock-screen Now Playing come for free. Only AVKit's own visible chrome is hidden; its backend stays in place.
- **Track switching.** A tracks sheet lists audio and subtitle tracks, with an "Off" option for subtitles and support for attaching a sidecar `.srt`.
- **Recents.** Recently opened files show up on Home with cached thumbnails for quick re-open.

## Build

Generated by XcodeGen:

```bash
brew install xcodegen
xcodegen generate
xcodebuild -project AetherPlayer.xcodeproj -scheme AetherPlayer -destination 'platform=macOS' build
xcodebuild -project AetherPlayer.xcodeproj -scheme AetherPlayer-iOS -destination 'generic/platform=iOS' build
```

## Release build

```bash
DEVELOPER_ID="Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAMID)" \
NOTARY_PROFILE="NOTARY_PROFILE" \
./Scripts/build-dmg.sh
```

Produces a notarized, stapled universal `.dmg`. Set `DEVELOPER_ID` for a signed local build; add `NOTARY_PROFILE` to notarize for distribution.

## Built with

Vibe-coded and maintained by [Vincent Herbst](https://github.com/superuser404notfound) in close pair-programming with **Claude** (Anthropic). The heavy lifting (demux, decode, HDR, audio) lives in [AetherEngine](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine); this repo is the macOS and iOS/iPadOS shell around it.

## License

[LGPL-3.0](LICENSE), matching AetherEngine and upstream FFmpeg.
